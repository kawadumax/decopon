- **Organize Tasks with Nested Lists**: Organize your tasks in a list format for easy management.
- **Easy Logging**: Add tags to each task to categorize them easily.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find tasks using keywords or tags.

## ðŸŽ¯ Theoretical Background: Challenges Decopon Aims to Solve

People with ADHD often struggle with **procrastination and difficulty completing tasks**. Research suggests that these difficulties can be attributed to three major factors:

1. **Challenges with self-monitoring**
2. **Limited working memory**
3. **Dopamine deficiency, leading to a lack of motivation ("task inertia")**

Decopon is designed to address these issues through targeted features.

### **1. Helping with Self-Monitoring**
One of the core challenges for people with ADHD is keeping track of **progress and performance**. To address this, Decopon provides **automatic behavior tracking**.

- **Records when you start and stop a focus session**
- **Logs completed tasks automatically**
- **Tracks the number of focus sessions per week**

With this data, you can analyze your performance patterns:  
*"When am I most productive?"* / *"What situations lead to procrastination?"*  
Over time, this self-awareness can help you understand when and why you tend to procrastinate.

**â†’ Gain insights into your work habits and procrastination triggers.**

### **2. Managing Limited Working Memory**
People with ADHD often struggle with **holding multiple pieces of information in their minds at once**. Decopon provides a structured way to break down tasks.

- **Subtasks can be broken down into infinite layers** (technically limited by system performance, but practically sufficient)
- **Chat-style notes allow you to offload temporary information**
- **Break big tasks into smaller, manageable steps**

Instead of trying to juggle everything at once, Decopon encourages you to:
1. **Forget large tasks and focus only on the next step.**
2. **Write down extra details and let go of unnecessary mental clutter.**

**â†’ Reduce cognitive overload and stay focused on the task at hand.**

### **3. Overcoming Dopamine Deficiency ("Task Inertia")**
A lack of dopamine makes it difficult for people with ADHD to **initiate and sustain effort on tasks**.  
To counter this, Decopon integrates **Pomodoro-style focus sessions** to create a **game-like challenge**.

- **Time constraints create a sense of urgency, helping boost motivation**
- **Tracking how many sessions you complete turns productivity into a "hunting game"**
- **Tedious obligations start to feel more like a "work game"**

Dopamine is known to be released when pursuing a goal.  
By structuring work as **a sequence of small "hunts" (short focus sessions)**, Decopon leverages this **natural drive** to improve engagement.

**â†’ Convert boring tasks into a structured game-like challenge.**
