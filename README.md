# Decopon - The Task Manager for ADHD

**Naming**

Just as a Dekopon is segmented into juicy segments, "Decopon" represents our approach to breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more digestible chunks.

**Overview**

Originally conceived as a countermeasure against procrastination for individuals with ADHD. This software is currently in a pre-alpha stage and not yet ready for public use. If you're interested, please star this repository.

**Tech Stack**

*This system is currently composed of Laravel Breeze and React.*

## Features

- **Focus Sessions with Pomodoro Technique**: A timer that breaks your work into 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break.
- **Organize Tasks with Nested Lists**: Organize your tasks in a list format for easy management.
- **Easy Logging**: Add tags to each task to categorize them easily.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find tasks using keywords or tags.


## Support the Project

As someone living with ADHD and severe anxiety disorder, I find it challenging to maintain stable employment. I started this project primarily for my own needs, but I've decided to make it public in the hope that it might help others facing similar challenges.
